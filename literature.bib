However, it is often difficult to use containers to manage the cloud infrastructure, without sacrificing many benefits container offers. This paper identifies the key challenges that impede realizing the full promise of containerizing infrastructure services. Using OpenStack as a case study, we explore solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we redesign OpenStack deployment architecture to enable dynamic service registration and discovery, explore different ways to manage service state in containers, and enable containers to access the host kernel and devices. We quantify the efficiency of the container-based microservice-style DevOps compared to the VM-based approach, and study the scalability of the stateless and stateful containerized components. We also discuss limitations in our current design, and highlight open research problems that, if solved, can lead to wider adoption of containers in cloud infrastructure management.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/IC2E.2016.26},  ISSN={},  month={April},}

Although agile practices emphasize self-organization and customer collaboration, we know little about how customers influence agile adoption within self-organizing teams. Here, we analyze how a commissioned software team engaged in customer collaboration during agile adoption at a Danish IT service provider. Our case study shows that the software team's transition to self-organized teamwork practices, agile planning routines, and active customer engagement was mutually dependent on the customer's trust in the software team and flexible collaborative routines. As a result, we advance a theoretical perspective of customer influence on agile adoption within commissioned software teams, implying that both software teams and customers need to navigate a contradictory tension between self-organization and collaboration to become agile together.}
