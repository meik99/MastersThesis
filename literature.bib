Hardly anybody will be able to approach it with a cookbook-style approach, but most developers will benefit from better connecting the previously isolated silos of development and operations. Many DevOps tools exist that can help them do this.},

Paddy Power has been implementing CD for the past two years. This article explains why Paddy Power decided to adopt CD, describes the resulting CD capability, and reports the huge benefits and challenges involved. These experiences can provide fellow practitioners with insights for their adoption of CD, and the identified challenges can provide researchers valuable input for developing their research agendas.},

delivery of new software updates while guaranteeing their correctness and reliability.
The present survey investigates and discusses DevOps challenges from the perspective
of engineers, managers, and researchers. We review the literature and develop a DevOps
conceptual map, correlating the DevOps automation tools with these concepts. We then
discuss their practical implications for engineers, managers, and researchers. Finally,
we critically explore some of the most relevant DevOps challenges reported by the
literature.},

Automated builds, a thorough test suite, and committing to the mainline branch every day sound simple at first, but they require a responsible team to implement and constant care. What starts with improved tooling can be a catalyst for long-lasting change in your company's shipping culture. Continuous integration is more than a set of practices, it's a mindset that has one thing in mind: increasing customer value. The Web extra at http://youtu.be/tDl_cHfrJZo is an audio podcast of the Tools of the Trade column discusses how continuous integration is more than a set of practices, it's a mindset that has one thing in mind: increasing customer value.},
