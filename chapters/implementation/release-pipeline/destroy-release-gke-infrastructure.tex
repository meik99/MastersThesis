\subsection{Destroy release GKE infrastructure}\label{subsec:destroy-release-gke-infrastructure}

This task uses \verb|terraform| to destroy the GKE cluster.
First, a GKE service account is read from the corresponding Vault secret and written to \verb|account.json|.
This service account is needed to authenticate with GKE.
Then, \verb|terraform| is executed to destroy the cluster.
Finally, the \verb|kube-config| Vault secret is deleted again.
