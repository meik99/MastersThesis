\subsection{create-release-gke-infrastructure}\label{subsec:create-release-gke-infrastructure}

This task uses `terraform` to deploy a GKE cluster and create the necessary infrastructure for the GCM release.
First, the `terraform` configuration is read from the `{terraform_config}` parameter and written to `terraform.tfvars`.
Then, a GKE service account is read from the corresponding Vault secret and written to `account.json`.
This service account is needed to authenticate with GKE.
Finally, `terraform` is executed with the given configuration to create the cluster.

\subsubsection{Purpose}\label{subsubsec:crgi-Purpose}

This task is needed to create the infrastructure needed to sanity check the deployer image of the [release-gke](../release%20tasks/release-gke.md) job.
