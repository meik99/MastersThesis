\subsection{Create release GKE infrastructure}\label{subsec:create-release-gke-infrastructure}

This task uses \verb| terraform | to deploy a GKE cluster and create the necessary infrastructure for the GCM release.
First, the \verb| terraform | configuration is read from the \verb| {terraform_config} | parameter and written to \verb| terraform.tfvars |.
Then, a GKE service account is read from the corresponding Vault secret and written to \verb| account.json |.
This service account is needed to authenticate with GKE.
Finally, \verb| terraform | is executed with the given configuration to create the cluster.
This task is needed to create the infrastructure needed to sanity check the deployer image of the GKE release.
