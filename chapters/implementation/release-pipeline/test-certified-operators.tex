\subsection{test-certified-operators}\label{subsec:test-certified-operators}

This task runs RedHat's CI pipeline for Operators to check if they can be merged into their [certified-operators](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators) repository.
First, the Vault secret `openshift` is read and written to `~/.kube/config` to allow for a connection to the cluster.
Then, `tekton` the CI tool that is needed for RedHat's CI pipeline, is downloaded and installed.
Afterwards, the manifests for the pipeline and its tasks are applied.
Finally, the pipeline is started using `tekton`.

The `tekton` command uses the following parameters.

\subsubsection{Important note}\label{subsubsec:test-certified-operators-important-note}

Since `tekton` only shows logs of a pipeline tasks which runs in a cluster, it does not exit with an error code if a task fails.
This means, that even if the bundle does not pass the verification, this task is still "green" and marked as successful.
It must be manually checked whether all CI pipeline tasks have succeeded.

\subsubsection{Purpose}\label{subsubsec:test-certified-operators-purpose}

This task starts RedHat's CI pipeline for operators and runs it for the certified-operators bundle.
It is used to debug CSV files and OLM deployment, as it is faster and generates more helpful logs as RedHat's hosted CI pipeline.
