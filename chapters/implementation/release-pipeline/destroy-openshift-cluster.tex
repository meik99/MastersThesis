\textbf{Destroy OpenShift cluster}

This task destroys and deletes an Openshift cluster from AWS infrastructure.
First, it unzips the state file in the S3 bucket created in a previous task.
Then, the Openshift installer is downloaded.
The process of downloading this installer here is the same as for creating the cluster.

When the installer has finished, it is checked whether a \verb|metadata.json| file exists in the state file.
If it does not exist, it is assumed that there is no cluster to destroy.
If it does exist, the installer is called with the \verb|destroy| option, destroying the cluster.
Finally, the installer state, which was written by the installer, is then zipped and uploaded to the S3 bucket.
