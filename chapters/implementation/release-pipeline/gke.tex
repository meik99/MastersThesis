\subsection{GKE infrastructure}\label{subsec:gke-infrastructure}


These group of tasks manage the creation and configuration of a GKE infrastructure.
This infrastructure can then be used to test the releases for the Google Marketplace.
A running GKE infrastructure is needed for the GKE release, as deploying the deployer image is embedded in the release task and to deploy the image a running cluster is needed.
