This section discusses the tasks implemented as part of the main release pipeline.
In Figure~\ref{fig:implemented-release-pipeline} the final implementation of this pipeline part is depicted.
The boxes contain the names of the tasks, while the freestanding text depicts the resources they either consume or produce.
Most of them consume the DTO's repository and the release-data generated by the previous task.
They then generate a new version of the release-data, amended with the data generated by the tasks.
