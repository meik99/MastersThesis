\section{Release pipeline}\label{sec:release-pipeline}

In this section, the implementation of the release pipeline is explained.
For each task of the pipeline, the following questions are answered.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What does the task do and how does it do it?
    \item Why does it do it?
\end{itemize}

Futhermore, this section is split into three parts.
First, the main release tasks.
These tasks are the steps necessary to generate a release for the DTO and release it on the mentioned marketplaces.
Then, there are tasks specific for GKE and OpenShift.
These tasks are used to create either a GKE or an OpenShift infrastructure to test the release on.

Note that there is a distinction between the tests for the DTO generated by the DTF and the tests using this infrastructure.
The former tests the DTO itself.
They test if the latest changes to the DTO did not introduce any faults to established functionality.
The latter test if the release artifacts themselves, e.g., the Helm chart, work as intended.
