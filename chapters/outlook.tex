\chapter{Outlook}\label{ch:outlook}

The work in this thesis has shown that there is a lot of potential with automating the distribution of systems.
This automation, however, is only necessary due to the currently fragmented market and multiple ways of running and maintaining an operator.
There are clear indications for the need for some kind of standard.
Since the RHMP is one of the biggest ones and OpenShift already uses OLM by default, CSV files are good candidates for a starting point.
Although, if made to a standard, their names must be changed to something sensible and less ambiguous.

This work also shows that testing systems that need very complex environments is difficult.
Not because the system itself is complex, but a lot of resources are needed to adequately test it.
Further research into the alleviation of this problem is necessary.
A team of software engineers, DevOps specialists and infrastructure engineers discussing this problem in more depth would be a start.
Also, a standardized cluster could be defined, so only one environment must be tested on to make sure any given feature works, instead of multiple.
