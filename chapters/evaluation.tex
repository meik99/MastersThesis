\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}

Now that the background and implementation for this project have been discussed, this section deals with the evaluation of the implementation.
Evaluation for each is done by finding an answer to the following research questions.

\textit{RQ1}: How useful is the DTF in a practical context? \\
\textit{RQ2}: What is the productivity increase when using the release pipeline?

The evaluation for \textit{RQ1} and \textit{RQ2} are done separately, as they need different approaches.
These approaches are discussed in more detail in their respective sections.
