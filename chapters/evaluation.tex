\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}

Now that the background and implementation for this project have been discussed, this section deals with the evaluation of the implementation.
The evaluation for \textit{Q1} and \textit{Q2} are done separately, as they need different approaches.
These approaches are discussed in their respective sections.
