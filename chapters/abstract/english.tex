\textbf{Introduction}: The Dynatrace Operator is a software system that is released to multiple marketplaces and needs extensive infrastructure to be tested. \\
\textbf{Objectives}: This project aims to simplify the release to multiple marketplaces and to develop a tool to ease creating the infrastructure for testing purposes. \\
\textbf{Methods}: In order to achieve this, two systems are created.
First, a so-called pipeline, which integrates the automatic release to multiple marketplaces into a single system.
Secondly, a tool to abstract the creation of a test infrastructure. \\
\textbf{Results}: The results show a $75 \%$ decrease in time needed for a release using the aforementioned pipeline.
However, the system to abstract test infrastructure replaces one set of complexity with a different one. \\
\textbf{Conclusion}: This paper shows that, while it is possible to greatly decrease labor cost when releasing software, creating test infrastructure for a sufficiently complex system is a more complex topic.
Therefore, the need for a human specialist is difficult to remove using a software solution in regard to testing.
