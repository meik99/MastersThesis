\textbf{Introduction}:
Operators are software systems that can be released to multiple marketplaces and need extensive infrastructure to be tested. \\
\textbf{Objectives}:
This project aims to simplify the release to multiple marketplaces and to develop a tool to ease creating the infrastructure for testing purposes. \\
\textbf{Methods}:
In order to achieve this, two systems are created for a specific operator, the Dynatrace Operator.
First, a so-called pipeline, which integrates the automatic release to multiple marketplaces into a single system.
Secondly, a tool to abstract the creation of a test infrastructure. \\
\textbf{Results}:
An analysis of tickets, on which the work time was booked on, shows a $75 \%$ decrease in time needed for a release using the aforementioned pipeline.
The system to abstract test infrastructure, on the other hand, replaces one set of complexity with a different one according to the survey taken by the development team. \\
\textbf{Conclusion}:
This paper shows that it is possible to greatly decrease labor cost when releasing software.
Creating test infrastructure for a sufficiently complex system is a more nuanced topic.
Therefore, the need for a human specialist in this regard is difficult to remove using a software solution.
