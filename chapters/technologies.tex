\textbf{Concourse} is a CI/CD system that can be used to automate certain tasks and group them into a pipeline.
Tasks can then be run either concurrently or sequentially in the context of the pipeline they are grouped in.
In addition, resources to be used can be defined and added to tasks, so they are available to them.
Such resources can be files, online resources, storage locations or any number of information a task may need.
Concourse is used to implement the pipeline answering \textit{Q2}.
